      Here you can dynamically control the meta tags for each page
      This is especially useful for social networking sites like facebook that grab information
      from these meta tags to determine how links to your site appear on their site

      Keep in mind that index is providing these for each page already:
      meta(name='viewport', content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0')
      meta(name='title', content='#{title}')

            The idea behind GrassTweets.com is pretty simple: connect you,
             the grassroots activist, with your representatives, using the
             magic of Twitter!
         p.
            How does it work? Well that is simple too: you simply log in
             to this site with your Twitter account and go to the Tweet
             page. There you will be able to select the representatives
             that you want to tweet, compose a message, and instantly send
             it out to each of them individually. How cool is that?
